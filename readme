Q: After you push the feature branch, merge the feature branch with the
main branch locally, and push to the remote. What do you see locally and
remotely on github?

A: All 4 branches (the two local branches and the two remote branches) have the same commit history.

Q: Modify the text in readme file from ”hello world!” to ”hello world from
remote!” on github manually, and pull from the remote origin. Do you
see the update?

A: Yes.
